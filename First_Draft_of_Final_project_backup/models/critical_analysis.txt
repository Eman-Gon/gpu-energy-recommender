CRITICAL ANALYSIS: IS THIS JUST 'RUN AT NIGHT'?

[1] DAYTIME EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS
Daytime hours (9am-5pm):
  Total: 811 hours
  Efficient: 252 hours (31.1%)
  Inefficient: 559 hours (68.9%)
 GOOD: 31.1% of daytime is efficient NOT just 'run at night'!

[2] NIGHTTIME EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS
Nighttime hours (midnight-8am):
  Total: 720 hours
  Efficient: 513 hours (71.2%)
  Inefficient: 207 hours (28.8%)
 GOOD: Only 71.2% of nighttime is efficient shows nuance!

[3] RULE-BASED VS ML COMPARISON
Rule 1 'Always run at night (midnight-8am)': 64.2%
Rule 2 'Run when price < $44/MWh': 78.4%
Rule 3 'Run when GPU util < 60%': 70.5%

Your ML Model: 97.6%

Improvement over best rule: 19.2 percentage points

 EXCELLENT: Simple rules fail ML is clearly needed!

[4] ERROR ANALYSIS - WHERE DO SIMPLE RULES FAIL?

'Run at night' rule makes 774 errors:
  - 207 False Positives: Night hours that were INEFFICIENT
    Average price: $49.51/MWh
    Average utilization: 57.4%
    Average jobs: 66
  - 567 False Negatives: Day hours that were EFFICIENT
    Average price: $41.60/MWh
    Average utilization: 45.2%
    Average jobs: 104

FINAL thoughs
 [+3] Significant daytime efficiency (>20%)
 [+3] Nighttime is not always efficient (<85%)
 [+3] ML improves >15 points over 'night' rule (33.4 points)

TOTAL SCORE: 9/9

 VERDICT: Your project has REAL ML value NOT trivial!
 You're discovering nuanced patterns beyond 'run at night'
