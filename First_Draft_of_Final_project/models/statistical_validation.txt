[1] McNemar's Test: ML vs 'Run at Night' Rule
------------------------------------------------------------
Both correct:           334
Both wrong:             10
ML correct, Rule wrong: 194
Rule correct, ML wrong: 3

McNemar's statistic: 183.25
P-value: 0.00e+00
✅ HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT (p < 0.001)
   ML improvement over baseline is NOT due to chance

[2] 95% Confidence Intervals
------------------------------------------------------------
ML Model:    97.6% (95% CI: 95.9% - 98.6%)
Rule-based:  62.3% (95% CI: 58.1% - 66.3%)

✅ Confidence intervals DON'T overlap
   ML is definitively better than baseline

[3] Effect Size (Cohen's h)
------------------------------------------------------------
Cohen's h: 1.011
→ LARGE effect size

============================================================
VERDICT
============================================================
✅ ML improves accuracy by 35.3 percentage points
✅ Improvement is statistically significant (p < 0.001)
✅ With 95% confidence, ML accuracy is between 95.9% - 98.6%
✅ Effect size is 1.01 (LARGE)

🎯 STRONG CONCLUSION: ML model is definitively superior
   - Statistically significant improvement
   - Confidence intervals don't overlap
   - Large effect size
